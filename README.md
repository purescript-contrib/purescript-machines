Machines is a library for building finite state machines. Finite state machines are useful for modeling many concerns that developers face. They help you describe a set of possible states and rules for how to transition from one state to another. The result is a complete view of possible states and transitions between states.

Currently this library implements [Mealy machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine) with halting.
